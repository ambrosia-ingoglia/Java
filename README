For this project, we created a library system with two different menus. This allows different users to have different menus.
To access the librarian menu, the librarian must put in the password(default set to cookie). Both menus allow the user to 
search for books and exit their user menus using the command 'stop'. The librarian can create two types of reports, a student 
report or a book report. The librarian also allows the librarian to search for a specific student in the list of students.
